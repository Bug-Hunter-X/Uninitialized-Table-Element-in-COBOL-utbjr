This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving uninitialized table elements. The bug.cob file contains the erroneous code, where the WS-ITEM variable within the WS-TABLE is used without being initialized. This leads to undefined behavior during processing. The bugSolution.cob file provides the corrected code where the WS-ITEM is explicitly initialized before use. This example highlights the importance of proper variable initialization in COBOL to prevent unexpected program behavior and potential errors.  Always initialize your data structures before using them in your COBOL programs.
